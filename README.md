Documentation of scripts used to parse high-throughput sequencing data

This repository will contain random, mostly unrelated scripts for the
purposes of documenting bioinformatic pipelines in publications. Most
of these will be written in such a way that typically only persons
familiar with linux or Unix or python stuff will be able to use them.
